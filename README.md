# Elastic-List-with-D3

### Developed for UBC VPRIO and the Dataset is confidential (so this repo doesn't contain the dataset)
### Realize Many-to-Many relationship matching

#### Inspired by [Elastic lists from Moritz Stefaner](http://archive.stefaner.eu/projects/elastic-lists/) 

#### Improved the One-to-One Matching from [Siris Academic](https://github.com/sirisacademic/d3-elastic-list) to Many-to-Many Elastic List without using any additional API and Libraries
